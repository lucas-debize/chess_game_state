# BETA TEST PLAN – Elyrii

## 1. Project Context

Elyrii is a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) designed to provide emotional support and foster positive habits for young people experiencing social isolation. Built with Flutter, the application combines an AI-powered personal assistant (powered by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B conversational model) with a gamified system of daily objectives, quests, and wellness features.

### Core Objectives

- Deliver coherent, emotionally intelligent AI conversations through a personalized mascot
- Encourage positive behavioral habits via gamification (challenges, objectives, reward systems)
- Provide wellness tools (guided meditation, structured journaling)
- Enable mood tracking and longitudinal well-being progression visualization

### Technical Architecture

The backend operates as a microservices architecture using TypeScript/Hono, with discrete services handling authentication, chat interactions, journaling, quest management, and notifications. Data persistence uses PostgreSQL for relational data and Redis for caching and real-time operations. This architecture supports horizontal scaling and ensures service resilience during high-concurrency testing scenarios.

## 2. Beta Testing Scope & User Roles

Beta testing encompasses all primary user interactions with Elyrii. The following role will be validated during this testing phase:

**Table: Beta Testing User Roles**

| Role Name | Description | Test Responsibilities |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| User | A regular Elyrii user who interacts with the AI mascot, completes challenges, manages journal entries, accesses wellness features, and customizes their experience | Validate feature functionality, test user workflows end-to-end, report bugs and usability issues, provide feedback on AI response quality and gamification mechanics |
